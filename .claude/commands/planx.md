# /planx

Produce a concise plan another AI can execute with zero extra context. Plan only — no implementation, no code execution, no edits outside the plan dir.

## Goal
$ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. **Resolve path.** Run `date +%Y`, `date +%m`, `date +%d`. Dir = `docs/plans/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/`. `Glob docs/plans/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/1*` → next number = highest existing `1NN-*` + 1, else `101`. Slug = kebab-case title, max 5 words. Final plan dir: `docs/plans/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<1NN>-<slug>/`.

2. **Explore.** `Task` (subagent_type=Explore, thoroughness="very thorough"): existing patterns + files to touch (`file:line`), the right layer(s) under `src/*` (transport / auth / authz / tools / exec / audit / config / state — one reason to change per layer, don't blur), the typed errors in `src/errors.rs` + stable client codes (`docs/initial-idea/03-mcp-tools.md`), the canonical spec in `docs/initial-idea/`, tests (unit = pure logic no DB / integration = booted against real Postgres), gotchas. Prefer `codegraph_explore` for structural lookups. Skip only for trivial asks.

3. **Write the plan as multiple files** in the plan dir — never one big `plan.md`. Always produce an `overview.md` index plus one `<NN>-<aspect>.md` per separable area (e.g. `01-authz-grant.md`, `02-tool.md`, `03-exec.md`, `04-audit.md`, `05-state-migration.md`, `06-tests.md`). Split by layer/area so each file is independently executable and stays short. Match the house style in `docs/initial-idea/` — terse fragments, `file:line` refs, tables.

   **`overview.md`** — the map. Sections:

```markdown
# <Title>

## Goal
1-2 sentences: what + why.

## Context
- Stack facts the executor needs (Rust stable, tokio, axum, sqlx postgres-first, hand-rolled JSON-RPC over HTTP+SSE, serde+YAML config validated at boot, Postgres state store — only what's relevant).
- Which of the CLAUDE.md Non-negotiables this touches (credentials never leave the gateway / SSO identity → audit row / read-only by default / synchronous audit / permissions in YAML-by-PR or SSO admin API).
- Reference patterns: `src/<layer>/<thing>.rs:12` — follow this for Z.
- `(security review required)` label needed? (touching `src/auth/`, `src/authz/`, credential loading, audit write path, any new MCP tool, or SQL execution).

## Plan files (execute in order)
1. [`01-<aspect>.md`](01-<aspect>.md) — one line: what it covers.
2. [`02-<aspect>.md`](02-<aspect>.md) — ...

## Done when
- Verifiable acceptance criteria spanning the whole feature. Includes: `bin/lint` clean, `bin/test` green, audit rows asserted for every tool path (incl. `outcome: forbidden` on failed authz).

## Risks / open questions
- Anything the executor must decide or watch (authz constraint-merge edges, timeout/row-cap/cancellation, credential leakage in errors/logs).
```

   **Each `<NN>-<aspect>.md`** — one slice of work. Sections:

```markdown
# <NN> — <Aspect>

> Part of [`overview.md`](overview.md). Depends on: <NN-prior or "none">.

## Files to change
- `path:line` — what changes, why.

## Steps
1. Ordered, concrete actions. Reference `Type::method` / `file:line`, don't restate.

## Tests
- What to add/run. Tests written with the code. Unit = pure logic (no real DB); integration = real Postgres, NEVER mock the target DB; property tests (`proptest`) for authz constraint-merge. Command: `bin/test` (or `bin/test --test <name>` / `cargo test <pattern>`), `bin/lint`.

## Done when
- Verifiable acceptance criteria for this slice.
```

4. **Write a `status.yml`** in the plan dir (alongside `overview.md`) — the live tracker for this plan. New plans start `not_started` / `0%`. Get `created_by` + `owner` from `git config user.name` (the person running /planx). Leave `worked_by` empty — the executor sets it to their own `git config user.name` when they pick the plan up, so a plan written by one person can be worked by another. Shape:

```yaml
plan: <1NN>-<slug>
title: <human title from overview.md>
status: not_started        # not_started | in_progress | blocked | complete | superseded
created_by: <git config user.name>   # who authored the plan
worked_by: ""              # who is executing it; empty = unclaimed; executor fills with their git user.name
owner: <git config user.name>
percent: 0                 # 0–100, overall completion
current_focus: ""          # where it's at right now / next slice to pick up
slices:                    # one row per <NN>-<aspect>.md slice
  - file: 01-<aspect>.md
    status: not_started      # not_started | in_progress | complete
    percent: 0
evidence: []               # commits/PRs proving progress, e.g. ["#42", "abc1234"]
notes: ""
last_updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

   Keep `status.yml` machine-readable (valid YAML, the enums above). It's the one file in the plan dir that IS a tracker — the `.md` slices stay reference maps (no checkboxes there).

## Rules
- Compact English. Fragments over sentences. `file:line` and `Type::method` symbol refs over prose. Tables for structured data.
- Reference-only: point at code, don't paste it or re-explain it ("follow `x.rs` but ...").
- No checkboxes (`[ ]`). Plain bullets. The plan is a reference map, not a tracker.
- Multiple files always: `overview.md` + `<NN>-<aspect>.md` slices. Never a single `plan.md`.
- Self-contained: executor reads only `overview.md`, the slice it's on, and the files those cite.
- Respect `CLAUDE.md` + the spec in `docs/initial-idea/`: DB credentials never leave the gateway (not in responses/logs/errors/admin endpoints); every DB call traces to an SSO identity → audit row; read-only by default (writes need explicit per-grant opt-in AND a target-DB write role; gateway never provisions write grants); audit is synchronous (write commits **before** the success response; audit fails → request fails); permissions live in YAML-by-PR or the SSO-gated admin API — no in-band admin UI. Behavior change → update the spec in `docs/initial-idea/` in the same PR.
- Rust rules: idiomatic boring readable Rust, `clippy -D warnings` is the floor. Typed errors (`thiserror` for domain; `anyhow` only at `main.rs`); every client error a stable code. No `unwrap`/`expect` outside `main`/tests — propagate with `?`. Newtype over bare primitives; make illegal states unrepresentable (`enum` over `bool`+`Option`). Derive don't hand-roll; keep `pub` minimal. Borrow by default; `Arc<T>` for shared read-only. No premature abstraction — concrete first, trait on the second impl. Async end-to-end: no `std::sync::Mutex` on the request path, never hold a `std` guard across `.await`, offload blocking with `spawn_blocking`. Per-DB pools sized by config — never a global pool, never shared across `(server, database)`. Cancellation-safe: disconnect → `pg_cancel_backend` → audit `outcome: cancelled`. Files ≤300 LOC. `tracing` not `println`; every tool dispatch a span with `request_id`, `user`, `server`, `database`.
- Security-sensitive slices (`src/auth/`, `src/authz/`, credential load/store, audit write path, any new MCP tool, SQL execution — timeouts/row caps/cancellation) → note `(security review required)` label in the slice and what reviewers look for (credentials in errors/logs, missing audit rows, authz bypass via constraint-merge, SQL injection / timeout bypass).
- State-DB changes → one `<NN>-<aspect>.md` covering the migration under `src/state/` and its ordering vs the code that reads it.

## Output
```
✓ docs/plans/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<1NN>-<slug>/overview.md
  + 01-<aspect>.md, 02-<aspect>.md, … (one per area)
  + status.yml (tracker — status/owner/percent/current_focus)
Next: run an executor on overview.md.
```
